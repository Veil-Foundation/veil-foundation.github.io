intro: Florian has worked with and based most of his professional work around Open Source software. In 2013, he decided to dig deeper into the fundamentals of the open source money movement around Bitcoin and hasn't stopped ever since. Florian is a regular public speaker. His focus since then are privacy focussed, governance and storage projects. When he is not hacking on hardware projects or looking into bleeding edge IT-security stuff and its implications for cryptocurrency projects, he is either playing retro games or enjoying a good after work run. Marsmensch will contribute his technical expertise into the Veil advisory board and help developing the process of evaluation and methodology for technological review of projects that apply for future grants.
past_contributions: I do a lot of stuff with masternodes and security ;-)
