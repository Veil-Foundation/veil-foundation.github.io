        The Veil Foundation is a non-profit organization responsible for overseeing and managing funding of Veil Foundation, and funding external activities through the Veil Grant Proposal (VGPs) process.
      </p>

      <p>Launched in January 2018, the mission of the <a href="https://veil-project.com">Veil Project</a> is to create the world's best privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Veil's protocol includes a budget emission to fund a dedicated research and development entity known as Veil Labs, whose mission is to push the frontiers of cryptography and blockchain technology, not only for the betterment of the Veil cryptocurrency, but the privacy industry in general.</p>

      <p>The Veil Foundation is a non-profit entity charged with overseeing the activities and administering the funding of Veil Labs. This mission is principally facilitated through evaluation, funding and management of external activities initiated through the Veil Grant Proposal process.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Veil Grant Proposals</h2>
      
      <p>The scope of activities subject to funding is broad, and can include technical improvements to the Veil protocol itself, development of consumer facing products, and/or marketing and strategic partnership activities that promote adoption of the currency. Improvements to the Veil protocol itself should be accompanied by a Veil Improvement Protocol (VIP), submitted to and approved by the Veil development team. <a href="/vgp/">Learn more...</a></p>
