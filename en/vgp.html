The Veil Foundation seeks to provide grants to organizations and individuals aiming to improve the Veil Project, and its mission to create the world's best privacy cryptocurrency. 
</p>


<h2>Veil Grant Proposal Process</h2>

<p>
The process for submitting a proposal is as follows:
</p>


<ol>
	<li><strong>Scope</strong> — The scope of activities subject to funding is broad, and can include technical improvements to the Veil protocol itself, development of consumer facing products, and/or marketing and strategic partnership activities that promote adoption of the currency. Improvements to the Veil protocol itself should be accompanied by a Veil Improvement Protocol (VIP), submitted to and approved by the Veil development team.</li>
	<li><strong>Budget</strong> — The maximum grant amount is $10,000, paid in Veil, and limited to a maximum of 10,000 Veil (if the value of Veil at the time is less than $1.00.) </li>
	<li><strong>Template</strong> — The proposal should follow the template provided below. </li>
	<li><strong>Delivery</strong> — The proposal should be provided electronically in the form of a PDF document, sent to <a href="mailto:grants@veil-foundation.org">grants@veil-foundation.org</a>. If the size of the PDF is greater than 25MB, please send a link to download the document using a file-sharing service.</li>
	<li><strong>Receipt Confirmation</strong> — The Veil Foundation will respond with a confirmation of receipt within 24-48 hours.</li>
	<li><strong>Evaluation & Response</strong> — The evaluation period will generally take less than four weeks, during which time the Foundation may followup with additional informational queries. The Foundation will provide a response, either accepting the proposal for funding, or declining it.</li>
	<li><strong>Funding</strong> — Successful proposals may receive immediate funding, or may be required to wait for the next Veil Superblock budget emission, which generally happens during the first week of each month. Prior to provision of funding, the grant will be formalized in a contract signed between the Foundation and recipient.</li>
	<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> — Upon funding and kick-off of the activity, grant recipients are required to provide progress reports by the first day of each month.</li>
</ol>
